# Contributing

Pull requests and contributions are warmly welcome.
Please follow existing code style and commit message conventions. Also remember to keep documentation
updated.

**Pull requests:** You don't need to bump version numbers or modify anything related to releasing. That stuff is fully automated, just write the functionality.

# Maintaining

Tests can be run with command:

* Commit all changes
* Run `./node_modules/.bin/releasor --bump minor`, which will create new tag and publish code to GitHub and npm. See https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/releasor for options
* Edit GitHub release notes
