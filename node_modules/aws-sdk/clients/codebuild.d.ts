ACTOR_ACCOUNT_ID    A webhook event triggers a build when a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket account ID matches the regular expression pattern.    HEAD_REF    A webhook event triggers a build when the head reference matches the regular expression pattern. For example, refs/heads/branch-name and refs/tags/tag-name.   Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push, GitHub and GitHub Enterprise pull request, Bitbucket push, and Bitbucket pull request events.    BASE_REF    A webhook event triggers a build when the base reference matches the regular expression pattern. For example, refs/heads/branch-name.    Works with pull request events only.     FILE_PATH    A webhook triggers a build when the path of a changed file matches the regular expression pattern.    Works with GitHub and GitHub Enterprise push events only.
