# component-cdn-uploader

Tool to upload web widgets to Auth0 CDN via S3 bucket.

## Install

via yarn

```
yarn add @auth0/component-cdn-uploader --dev
```

via npm

```
npm install @auth0/component-cdn-uploader --save-dev
```

## Configuration

In your `package.json` add the following entry

```json
"ccu": {
  "cdn": "https://cdn.auth0.com",
  "mainBundleFile": "lock.min.js",
  "bucket": "mybucket",
  "remoteBasePath": "js"
}
```

where

- cdn: url where your CDN can be found so the lib checks if a version is already uploaded
- mainBundleFile: name of the file used when checking the CDN if a specific version is already uploaded
- bucket: name of the S3 bucket to upload to
- remoteBasePath: path in the bucket where to store the component.

You can also have the following entries

- name: name of the folder inside `remoteBasePath` that overrides the default from package's name.
- snapshotName: name of the snapshot version that will override the default `development`

### Files Cryptographic Digest

If you need the digest of the files you upload you can also add inside `ccu` in your `package.json` the following

```json
"digest": {
  "hashes": ["sha384"]
}
```

This will generate the `sha384` digest of every file to upload and store it in a different file named `<filename>.<hash-method>`. In the case you only need to hash only some files, e.g. JS only

```json
"digest": {
  "hashes": ["sha384"],
  "extensions": [".js"]
}
```

> The valid types of digests are `sha256`, `sha384` and `sha512`, if none is specified the tool will generate no digest files.

## Usage

```
$ ccu [options] [directory ...]
```

options

- --type (string) type of upload flow to perform (one of 'default', 'release', 'snapshot')
- --only-full only upload full major-minor-patch version, ignored if type is 'snapshot'
- --dry perform a dry run
- --snapshot-name (string) name used for snapshot. Default is 'development'
- --silent run in silent mode
- --trace run with verbose log

### types

- default: will upload, if it does not exist in cdn (checking `mainBundleFile` existence), using full and major-minor tags (or full only if `only-full` is specified) or just the snapshot tag.
- release: will only upload, if it does not exist in cdn (checking `mainBundleFile` existence), using full and major-minor tags (or full only if `only-full` is specified) and no snaphost tag.
- snapshot: will always upload the snapshot tag.
