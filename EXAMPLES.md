## Logging Out

```html
<button id="logout">Logout</button>
```

```js
document.getElementById('logout').addEventListener('click', () => {
  auth0.logout();
});
```

You can redirect users back to your app after logging out. This URL must appear in the **Allowed Logout URLs** setting for the app in your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com):

```js
auth0.logout({
  logoutParams: {
    returnTo: 'https://your.custom.url.example.com/'
  }
});
```

## Calling an API

Retrieve an access token to pass along in the `Authorization` header using the `getTokenSilently` API.

```html
<button id="call-api">Call an API</button>
```

```js
//with async/await
document.getElementById('call-api').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const accessToken = await auth0.getTokenSilently();
  const result = await fetch('https://myapi.com', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  });
  const data = await result.json();
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Refresh Tokens

Refresh tokens can be used to request new access tokens. [Read more about how our refresh tokens work for browser-based applications](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/concepts/refresh-token-rotation) to help you decide whether or not you need to use them.

To enable the use of refresh tokens, set the `useRefreshTokens` option to `true`:

```js
await createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  useRefreshTokens: true,
  authorizationParams: {
    redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
  }
});
```

Using this setting will cause the SDK to automatically send the `offline_access` scope to the authorization server. Refresh tokens will then be used to exchange for new access tokens instead of using a hidden iframe, and calls the `/oauth/token` endpoint directly. This means that in most cases the SDK does not rely on third-party cookies when using refresh tokens.

**Note** This configuration option requires Rotating Refresh Tokens to be [enabled for your Auth0 Tenant](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/guides/configure-refresh-token-rotation).

### Refresh Token fallback

In all cases where a refresh token is not available, the SDK falls back to the legacy technique of using a hidden iframe with `prompt=none` to try and get a new access token and refresh token. This scenario would occur for example if you are using the in-memory cache and you have refreshed the page. In this case, any refresh token that was stored previously would be lost.

If the fallback mechanism fails, a `login_required` error will be thrown and could be handled in order to put the user back through the authentication process.

**Note**: This fallback mechanism does still require access to the Auth0 session cookie, so if third-party cookies are being blocked then this fallback will not work and the user must re-authenticate in order to get a new refresh token.

## Data caching options

The SDK can be configured to cache ID tokens and access tokens either in memory or in local storage. The default is in memory. This setting can be controlled using the `cacheLocation` option when creating the Auth0 client.

To use the in-memory mode, no additional options need are required as this is the default setting. To configure the SDK to cache data using local storage, set `cacheLocation` as follows:

```js
await createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',,
  cacheLocation: 'localstorage' // valid values are: 'memory' or 'localstorage',
  authorizationParams: {
    redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
  }
});
```

**Important:** This feature will allow the caching of data **such as ID and access tokens** to be stored in local storage. Exercising this option changes the security characteristics of your application and **should not be used lightly**. Extra care should be taken to mitigate against XSS attacks and minimize the risk of tokens being stolen from local storage.

### Creating a custom cache

The SDK can be configured to use a custom cache store that is implemented by your application. This is useful if you are using this SDK in an environment where more secure token storage is available, such as potentially a hybrid mobile app.

To do this, provide an object to the `cache` property of the SDK configuration.

The object should implement the following functions. Note that all of these functions can optionally return a Promise or a static value.

| Signature                        | Return type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get(key)`                       | Promise<object> or object      | Returns the item from the cache with the specified key, or `undefined` if it was not found                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `set(key: string, object: any) ` | Promise<void> or void          | Sets an item into the cache                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `remove(key)`                    | Promise<void> or void          | Removes a single item from the cache at the specified key, or no-op if the item was not found                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `allKeys()`                      | Promise<string[]> or string [] | (optional) Implement this if your cache has the ability to return a list of all keys. Otherwise, the SDK internally records its own key manifest using your cache. **Note**: if you only want to ensure you only return keys used by this SDK, the keys we use are prefixed with `@@auth0spajs@@` |

Here's an example of a custom cache implementation that uses `sessionStorage` to store tokens and apply it to the Auth0 SPA SDK:

```js
const sessionStorageCache = {
  get: function (key) {
    return JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(key));
  },

  set: function (key, value) {
    sessionStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  },

  remove: function (key) {
    sessionStorage.removeItem(key);
  },

  // Optional
  allKeys: function () {
    return Object.keys(sessionStorage);
  }
};

await createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  cache: sessionStorageCache,
  authorizationParams: {
    redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
  }
});
```

**Note:** The `cache` property takes precedence over the `cacheLocation` property if both are set. A warning is displayed in the console if this scenario occurs.

We also export the internal `InMemoryCache` and `LocalStorageCache` implementations, so you can wrap your custom cache around these implementations if you wish.

## Organizations

[Organizations](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations) is a set of features that provide better support for developers who build and maintain SaaS and Business-to-Business (B2B) applications.

### Log in to an organization

Log in to an organization by specifying the `organization` parameter when setting up the client:

```js
await createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  authorizationParams: {
    redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>',
    organization: '<MY_ORG_ID_OR_NAME>'
  }
});
```

You can also specify the organization when logging in:

```js
// Using a redirect
await client.loginWithRedirect({
  authorizationParams: {
    organization: '<MY_ORG_ID_OR_NAME>'
  }
});

// Using a popup window
await client.loginWithPopup({
  authorizationParams: {
    organization: '<MY_ORG_ID_OR_NAME>'
  }
});
```

### Switch to a different organization

When working with multiple organizations, there might be a situation where you want your users to be able to switch between different organizations.

To do this, clear the local logged in state from your application and login to Auth0 again, leveraging any existing Auth0 session to prevent the user from being prompted for their credentials.

```ts
async function switchOrganization(newOrganization: string) {
  await client.logout({ openUrl: false });
  await client.loginWithRedirect({
    authorizationParams: {
      organization: newOrganization
    }
  });
}
```

**Note:** Ensure to pass any additional parameters to `loginWithRedirect` (or `loginWithPopup`) just as you might have passed on other occurences of calling login.

### Accept user invitations

Accept a user invitation through the SDK by creating a route within your application that can handle the user invitation URL, and log the user in by passing the `organization` and `invitation` parameters from this URL. You can either use `loginWithRedirect` or `loginWithPopup` as needed.

```js
const url = new URL(invitationUrl);
const params = new URLSearchParams(url.search);
const organization = params.get('organization');
const invitation = params.get('invitation');

if (organization && invitation) {
  await client.loginWithRedirect({
    authorizationParams: {
      invitation,
      organization
    }
  });
}
```

## Custom Token Exchange (CTE)

Enable secure token exchange between external identity providers and Auth0 using RFC 8693 standards.

### Basic Implementation

```js
// Initialize client with custom token exchange configuration
const auth0 = await createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  authorizationParams: {
    audience: 'https://your-api.example.com'
  }
});

// Exchange external token for Auth0 tokens
async function performTokenExchange() {
  try {
    // Option 1: Use client's default audience
    const tokenResponse = await auth0.exchangeToken({
      subject_token: 'EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_TOKEN',
      subject_token_type: 'urn:example:external-token',
      scope: 'openid profile email'
      // audience will default to audience from client config
    });

    // Option 2: Specify custom audience for this token exchange
    const customTokenResponse = await auth0.exchangeToken({
      subject_token: 'EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_TOKEN',
      subject_token_type: 'urn:example:external-token',
      audience: 'https://different-api.example.com',
      scope: 'openid profile read:records'
    });

    console.log('Received tokens:', tokenResponse);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Exchange failed:', error);
  }
}
```

### Required Auth0 Configuration

1. **Create Token Exchange Profile** in Auth0 Dashboard:

```typescript
await managementClient.tokenExchangeProfiles.create({
  action_id: 'custom-auth-action',
  name: 'External System Exchange',
  subject_token_type: 'urn:example:external-token',
  type: 'custom_authentication'
});
```

2. **Add Required Scopes** to your API in Auth0:

```
urn:auth0:oauth2:grant-type:token-exchange
```

### Security Considerations

- Validate external tokens in Auth0 Actions using cryptographic verification
- Implement anti-replay mechanisms for subject tokens
- Store refresh tokens securely when using `offline_access` scope

### Error Handling

```js
async function safeTokenExchange() {
  try {
    return await auth0.exchangeToken(/* ... */);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.error === 'invalid_token') {
      // Handle token validation errors
      await auth0.logout();
      window.location.reload();
    }
    if (error.error === 'insufficient_scope') {
      // Request additional scopes
      await auth0.loginWithPopup({
        authorizationParams: {
          scope: 'additional_scope_required'
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```

[Token Exchange Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/token-exchange)  
[RFC 8693 Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693)

## Device-bound tokens with DPoP

**Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession** —or simply **DPoP**— is a recent OAuth 2.0 extension defined in [RFC9449](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449).

It defines a mechanism for securely binding tokens to a specific device using cryptographic signatures. Without it, **a token leak caused by XSS or other vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impersonate the real user.**

To support DPoP in `auth0-spa-js`, some APIs available in modern browsers are required:

- [Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto): allows to create and use cryptographic keys, which are used to generate the proofs (i.e. signatures) required for DPoP.

- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API): enables the use of cryptographic keys [without exposing the private material](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto#storing_keys).

The following OAuth 2.0 flows are currently supported by `auth0-spa-js`:

- [Authorization Code Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow) (`authorization_code`).

- [Refresh Token Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens) (`refresh_token`).

- [Custom Token Exchange Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/custom-token-exchange) (`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, only the `ES256` algorithm is supported.

### Enabling DPoP

DPoP is disabled by default. To enable it, set the `useDpop` option to `true` when creating the SDK instance. For example:

```js
const client = await createAuth0Client({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  useDpop: true,
  authorizationParams: {
    redirect_uri: '<MY_CALLBACK_URL>'
  }
});
```

After enabling DPoP, **every new session using a supported OAuth 2.0 flow in Auth0 will begin transparently to use tokens that are cryptographically bound to the current browser**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DPoP will only be used for new user sessions created after enabling it. Any previously existing sessions will continue using non-DPoP tokens until the user logs in again.
>
> You decide how to handle this transition. For example, you might require users to log in again the next time they use your application.

> [!NOTE]
> Using DPoP requires storing some temporary data in the user's browser. When you log the user out with `client.logout()`, this data is deleted.

> [!TIP]
> If all your clients are already using DPoP, you may want to increase security by making Auth0 reject any non-DPoP interactions. See [the docs on Sender Constraining](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/sender-constraining/configure-sender-constraining) for details.

### Using DPoP in your own requests

You use a DPoP token the same way as a "traditional" access token, except it must be sent to the server with an `Authorization: DPoP <token>` header instead of the usual `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

To determine the type of a token, use the `detailedResponse` option in `getTokenSilently()` to access the `token_type` property, which will be either `DPoP` or `Bearer`.

For internal requests sent by `auth0-spa-js` to Auth0, simply enable the `useDpop` option and **every interaction with Auth0 will be protected**.

However, **to use DPoP with a custom, external API, some additional work is required**. The `Auth0Client` class provides some low-level methods to help with this:

- `getDpopNonce()`
- `setDpopNonce()`
- `generateDpopProof()`

However, due to the nature of how DPoP works, **this is not a trivial task**:

- When a nonce is missing or expired, the request may need to be retried.
- Received nonces must be stored and managed.
- DPoP headers must be generated and included in every request, and regenerated for retries.

Because of this, we recommend using the provided `fetchWithAuth()` method, which **handles all of this for you**.

#### Simple usage

The `fetchWithAuth()` method is a drop-in replacement for the native `fetch()` function from the Fetch API, so if you're already using it, the change will be minimal.

For example, if you had this code:

```js
await fetch('https://api.example.com/foo', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: { 'user-agent': 'My Client 1.0' }
});

console.log(response.status);
console.log(response.headers);
console.log(await response.json());
```

You would change it as follows:

```js
const fetcher = client.createFetcher({
  dpopNonceId: 'my_api_request'
});

await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('https://api.example.com/foo', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: { 'user-agent': 'My Client 1.0' }
});

console.log(response.status);
console.log(response.headers);
console.log(await response.json());
```

When using `fetchWithAuth()`, the following will be handled for you automatically:

- Use `getTokenSilently()` to get the access token to inject in the headers.
- Generate and inject DPoP headers when needed.
- Store and update any DPoP nonces.
- Handle retries caused by a rejected nonce.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If DPoP is enabled in the `client` instance, a `dpopNonceId` **must** be present in the `createFetcher()` parameters, since it’s used to keep track of the DPoP nonces for each request.

#### Advanced usage

If you need something more complex than the example above, you can provide a custom implementation in the `fetch` property.

However, since `auth0-spa-js` needs to make decisions based on HTTP responses, your implementation **must return an object with _at least_ two properties**:

1. `status`: the response status code as a number.
2. `headers`: the response headers as a plain object or as a Fetch API’s Headers-like interface.

Whatever it returns, it will be passed as the output of the `fetchWithAuth()` method.

Your implementation will be called with a standard, ready-to-use [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object, which will contain any headers needed for authorization and DPoP usage (if enabled). Depending on your needs, you can use this object directly or treat it as a container with everything required to make the request your own way.

##### Example with `axios`

```js
const fetcher = client.createFetcher({
  dpopNonceId: 'my_api_request',
  fetch: (request) =>
    // The `Request` object has everything you need to do a request in a
    // different library. Make sure that your output meets the requirements
    // about the `status` and `headers` properties.
    axios.request({
      url: request.url,
      method: request.method,
      data: request.body,
      headers: Object.fromEntries(request.headers),
      timeout: 2000,
      // etc.
    }),
  },
});

const response = await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('https://api.example.com/foo', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'John Doe' }),
  headers: { 'user-agent': 'My Client 1.0' },
});

console.log(response.status);
console.log(response.headers);
console.log(response.data);
```

##### Timeouts with native `fetch()`

The Fetch API doesn’t support passing a timeout value directly; instead, you’re expected to use an [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal). For example:

```js
const fetcher = client.createFetcher();

await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('https://api.example.com/foo', {
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(2000)
});
```

This works, but if you define your request parameters statically when your app starts and then call `fetchWithAuth()` after an indeterminate amount of time, you'll find that **the request will timeout immediately**. This happens because the `AbortSignal` **starts counting time as soon as it is created**.

To work around this, you can pass a thin wrapper over the native `fetch()` so that a new `AbortSignal` is created each time a request is made:

```js
const fetcher = client.createFetcher({
  fetch: request => fetch(request, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(2000) })
});

await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('https://api.example.com/foo');
```

##### Having a base URL

If you need to make requests to different endpoints of the same API, passing a `baseUrl` to `createFetcher()` can be useful:

```js
const fetcher = client.createFetcher({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com'
});

await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('/foo'); // => https://api.example.com/foo
await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('/bar'); // => https://api.example.com/bar
await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('/xyz'); // => https://api.example.com/xyz

// If the passed URL is absolute, `baseUrl` will be ignored for convenience:
await fetcher.fetchWithAuth('https://other-api.example.com/foo');
```

##### Passing an access token

The `fetchWithAuth()` method assumes you’re using the SDK to get the access token for the request. This means that by default, it will always call `getTokenSilently()` internally before making the request.

However, if you already have an access token or need to pass specific parameters to `getTokenSilently()`, you can override this behavior with a custom access token factory, like so:

```js
client.createFetcher({
  getAccessToken: () =>
    client.getTokenSilently({
      authorizationParams: {
        audience: '<SOME_AUDIENCE>',
        scope: '<SOME_SCOPE>'
        // etc.
      }
    })
});
```
